    "summary": "Here's a summary of the web content in under 300 words:\n\nThe Sanchar Saathi app is a cybersecurity application developed by the Indian government to help users report fraudulent calls, messages, and stolen mobile phones. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) directed Indian smartphone companies to pre-install the app on all new devices sold in India. Initially, the DoT said users couldn't delete the app, but Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia later clarified that it's optional and users can delete the app if they want to.\n\nThe DoT's directive sparked criticism over privacy and surveillance issues, with some calling it a state-mandated software that users can't control or remove. Digital rights group Internet Freedom Foundation expressed concerns that the app will require system-level access, eroding protections that prevent one app from accessing data from others.\n\nKey facts:\n\n- The Sanchar Saathi app is a government-developed cybersecurity application.\n- The DoT directed Indian smartphone companies to pre-install the app on all new devices sold in India.\n- The initial directive said users couldn't delete the app, but it's now optional.\n- Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia clarified that users can delete the app if they want to.\n- The DoT directed a software update with the app to be issued to already-sold phones.\n- The directive was issued on November 28, 2025, under the Telecommunication Cybersecurity Amendment Rules, 2025.\n\nKey entities:\n\n- Sanchar Saathi app\n- Department of Telecommunications (DoT)\n- Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia\n- Internet Freedom Foundation\n- Indian government\n- Indian smartphone companies",
